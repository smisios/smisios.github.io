The Eastern Mediterranean has been identified as a climate hotspot, making this region particularly relevant for such as-sessments. Solar energy modelling provides a robust frame-work for extending solar resource analyses to projections of photovoltaic (PV) power generation. In this study, we per-formed simulations of PV output power with the Global Solar Energy Estimator (GSEE), with input surface solar radiation and temperature data from three global climate models that participated in the 6th phase of the Climate Model Intercom-parison Project (CMIP-6): CNRM-CM6-1-HR, INP-CM5-0, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR. Projections were evaluated under three different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs 245, 370, 585), focusing on four major cities in the region: Athens, Al-exandria, Istanbul and Nicosia. Both all-sky and clear-sky Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) were used as input to GSEE, with the contribution of cloudiness further examined through a comparison with the Cloud Modification Factor (CMF), defined as the ratio of all-sky to clear-sky GHI. Moreover, we investigated the sensitivity of system configu-ration to cloud-related variability, by simulating PV plants with fixed panels, single axis, and dual-axis tracking systems. The results indicate consistent shifts in solar resource availa-bility across scenarios, reflecting alterations in cloud patterns and distribution, and highlighting the role of climate change in shaping the long-term potential of PV power generation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">COMEACAP 2025</abbr> </div> <div id="misios_comecap2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mediterranean amplification in the LESFMIP simulations</div> <div class="author"> Misios al. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Mediterranean region is particularly sensitive to climate change as it is located at the crossroads of atmospheric processes. In the Mediterranean, and particularly in its eastern parts, the rate of warming is more pronounced than the global mean rate of warming, with projected increase up to 2.5-3.0 Â°C and simultaneous decrease in precipitation by the end of the century. Here, we investigate the contribution of different climate drivers to regional warming trends in the historical period, focusing in the summer season. We are analyzing surface and atmospheric temperature trends in simulations from the latest Large Ensemble Single Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (LESFMIP). Specifically, we analyze simulations under the a) historical, b) hist-GHG, c) hist-aer, d) hist-volc and e) hist-sol, experiments which enable the detection of responses to individual forcings over the historical period. The large ensemble size in the simulations facilitate the detection of forced signals on regional scales in the presence of internal variability. Model results are compared with trends in reanalysis datasets and long-term radiosonde soundings in selected locations in the eastern Mediterranean. Our analysis highlights the important role of aerosols in the observed summer-time temperature trends in the Mediterranean and mechanisms are discussed. Aerosol changes particularly after 1980 combined with post-eruption trends explains most of precipitation increases in the Mediterranean. Consistent with the surface amplification, the strongest warming in the upper troposphere is found in the June-July-August (JJA) season. Mechanisms explaining temperature and precipitation trends are discussed. The analysis has been conducted under the Large Ensembles for Attribution of Dynamically-driven ExtRemes (LEADER) activity and has been financed by the Public Investment Program of the Greek Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">COMEACAP 2025</abbr> </div> <div id="kartsios_comecap2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ClimateHub: Seasonal to decadal predictions for national renewable energy management</div> <div class="author"> Kartsios al. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>ClimateHub is the first National Collaboration Programme (NCP) in Greece supported by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). ClimateHub aims at delivering innovative services to national authorities regulating the energy sector by developing climate-based tools and services building on the C3S experience. As a service provider, ClimateHub will fill the knowledge and service gap on climate information at time scales exceeding the typical weather forecast. Two time horizons have been chosen, in which previous demonstrators in the C3S energy sector have shown considerable potential, specifically a) seasonal and b) decadal. Through a co-design approach, ClimateHub has identified three applications where public authorities have virtually no access on climate-related impacts on the renewable energy sources (RES) sector at these time scales, a) energy demand, b) solar power and c) wind power. This is consistent with the national plans described in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which projects RES generation mainly from solar and wind installations by 2030. During its first phase, a novel pre-operational prediction system based on the C3S seasonal forecasts and decadal predictions has been designed and developed to address national needs in climate information for RES production. In its second phase, skillful long-term predictions of essential climate variables such as wind speed, solar radiation, and surface temperature inform the energy industry about expected renewable energy production and energy consumption, and further prepare the sector for any possible risks, which may arise due to anomalies. In a nutshell, ClimateHub provides actionable climate and energy products to the national authorities, from a) seasonal and decadal predictions on climate-related electricity demand, b) seasonal forecasts of solar PV and onshore/offshore wind energy production and decadal outlooks in PV and offshore wind energy production, specifically in the summer, through its dedicated web portal (https://portal.climatehub.gr).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SWIM</abbr> </div> <div id="miller_swim2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Terrestrial Atmospheric and Climatological Responses to Recent (2-3 Mya) Encounters with Dense Interstellar Clouds</div> <div class="author"> Miller al. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recently, Opher et al. (2024) proposed that the Solar System passed through a dense interstellar cloud called the Local Lynx of Cold Clouds 2-3 million years ago. Due to the cloudâs high density and ram pressure, it would have greatly compressed the heliosphere to within Earthâs orbit, exposing Earth directly to the interstellar medium. Prior investigations into these events have used simple models and scaling relations. In this study, we utilize for the first time a state-of-the-art 3D climatological model (CESM/WACCM) to demonstrate the effects of interstellar hydrogen in Earthâs atmosphere. We examine how this source of high-altitude hydrogen modifies the chemistry and dynamics in the stratosphere and mesosphere. In particular, there is a broad depletion of mesospheric ozone and a corresponding decrease in temperature. We conclude with a discussion of potential surface effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">EGU 2025</abbr> </div> <div id="misios_egu2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Summer-time Mediterranean amplification to different climate drivers</div> <div class="author"> Misios al. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/misios_egu25_poster_v1.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Mediterranean region is particularly sensitive to climate change as it is located at the crossroads of atmospheric processes. In the Mediterranean, and particularly in itâs eastern parts, the rate of warming is more pronounced than the global mean rate of warming, with projected increase up to 2.5-3.0 Â°C and simultaneous decrease in precipitation of 15 % by the end of the century. Here, we investigate the contribution of different climate drivers to regional warming trends, focusing in the summer season. We are analyzing surface and atmospheric temperature trends in simulations from nine climate models participating in the Precipitation Driver and Response Model intercomparison project (PDRMIP). The model simulations have assumed idealized and abrupt forcing applied in global scale, specifically: doubling the CO2 concentrations, 10 times the present-day black carbon concentrations, 5 times the SO4 concentration, 3 times the CH4 concentration and 2% increase in total solar irradiance (TSI). Model results are compared with trends in reanalysis datasets and long-term radiosonde soundings in selected locations in the eastern Mediterranean. Increases in CO2, CH4 and TSI cause a very similar seasonal variation of the temperature amplification, with a stronger magnitude simulated at the upper troposphere. Consistent to the surface amplification, the strongest warming in the upper troposphere is found in the June-July-August (JJA) season. SO4 causes a stronger upper tropospheric temperature amplification, particularly in July and August. BC aerosols, on the other hand cause a considerably stronger amplification in the JJA season which spreads to the upper troposphere the following months. Our analysis highlights the important role of aerosols in the observed summer-time temperature trends in the Mediterranean and mechanisms are discussed. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">EGU 2025</abbr> </div> <div id="fountoulakis_egu2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Changes in the spectral composition of surface solar radiation under the presence of stratospheric aerosols: a case study for the Pinatubo eruption</div> <div class="author"> Fountoulakis al. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The presence of aerosols in the stratosphere alters the spectral shape, the amount and the spatial distribution of the solar light that reaches the Earth surface. Such changes in surface solar radiation have been discussed in a few studies, but the role of the underlying tropospheric aerosol layer in the presence of stratospheric aerosols has not been considered. In this study we investigate the changes in the direct and global spectral surface solar irradiances following the extremely intense volcanic eruption (VEI=6) of Mount Pinatubo (15Â°N, 120Â°E) in June 1991. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo ejected massive loads of sulphate and ash particles into the stratosphere, which covered the entire globe after three weeks and then remained in the stratosphere for several months. In the aftermath, major perturbations of the stratospheric ozone layer and the near-surface temperature have been documented. Here, we provide model-derived stratospheric aerosol optical properties, constrained by ground-based and airborne remote sensing and in-situ data, to the radiative transfer model libRadtran to calculate the spectral surface solar irradiance in the wavelength range 350 â 750 nm. Radiative transfer simulations have been performed for two European sites where in situ measurements of the aerosol extinction profile were available a few months after the eruption, assuming different concentrations and types of tropospheric aerosols present in the atmosphere along with the overlying stratospheric volcanic layers, as well as different solar zenith angles. Changes in the spectral composition and the distribution of surface solar radiation in the considered spectral range play a key role in many biological processes (e.g., photosynthesis), as well as in solar energy production. Thus, our results provide insights on how such processes could be impacted after future volcanic eruptions or under solar radiation modification scenarios. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> Â© Copyright 2025 Stergios Misios.
