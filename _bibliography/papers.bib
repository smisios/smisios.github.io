  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

   journal = {Journal of Climate},
   volume = {25},

   pages = {5102-5118},
   abstract = {It is debated whether the response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to the 11-yr solar cycle forcing resembles a La Nina- or El Nino-like signal. To address this issue, ensemble simulations employing an atmospheric general circulation model with and without ocean coupling are conducted. The coupled simulations show no evidence for a La Nina like cooling in solar maxima. Instead, the tropical sea surface temperature rises almost in phase with the 11-yr solar cycle. A basinwide warming of about 0.1 K is simulated in the tropical Pacific, whereas the warming in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans is weaker. In the western Pacific, the region of deep convection shifts to the east, thus reducing the surface easterlies. This shift is independent of the ocean coupling because deep convection moves to the east in the uncoupled simulations too. The reduced surface easterlies cool the subsurface but warm the surface due to the reduction of heat transport divergence. The latter mechanism operates together with water vapor feedback, resulting in a stronger tropical Pacific warming relative to the warming over the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. These results suggest that the atmospheric response to the 11-yr solar cycle drives the tropical Pacific response, which is amplified by atmosphere-ocean feedbacks operating on decadal time scales. Based on the coupled simulations, it is concluded that the tropical Pacific Ocean should warm when the sun is more active.},

   journal = {International Journal of Climatology},
   volume = {0},

   abstract = { Abstract Etesians are north to south direction winds in the lower atmosphere, blowing over the Aegean basin from early summer to early autumn. They are an important circulation component for the East Mediterranean (EMED) area, linked to the subsidence and ascent circulation over EMED and the extended Indian monsoon region, respectively. In this study we investigate the evolution of Etesian days and the associated wind speed (10 m) over the recent past (1979?2005) in simulations from Earth System Models (ESMs) available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Results from this analysis are compared to the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Moreover, we study the connection of the Etesians to the atmospheric circulation over EMED and the wider Indian monsoon area, in particular over the west Indian summer monsoon (wISM) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Our findings suggest that while the ESMs underestimate the wind speed of the Etesians, their frequency and summer cycle are in good agreement to reanalysis. ESMs can accurately represent the summer atmospheric circulation and depict the connection between EMED and Indian summer monsoon (ISM), capturing the link between them. Finally, we highlight here the capability and efficiency of ESMs in representing the climatology of Etesians and related atmospheric circulation.},

   abstract = {We describe and evaluate historical simulations which use the third Hadley Centre Global Environment Model in the Global Coupled configuration 3.1 (HadGEM3-GC3.1) model and which form part of the UK's contribution to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6. These simulations, run at two resolutions, respond to historically evolving forcings such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar irradiance, volcanic aerosols, land use, and ozone concentrations. We assess the response of the simulations to these historical forcings and compare against the observational record. This includes the evolution of global mean surface temperature, ocean heat content, sea ice extent, ice sheet mass balance, permafrost extent, snow cover, North Atlantic sea surface temperature and circulation, and decadal precipitation. We find that the simulated time evolution of global mean surface temperature broadly follows the observed record but with important quantitative differences which we find are most likely attributable to strong effective radiative forcing from anthropogenic aerosols and a weak pattern of sea surface temperature response in the low to middle latitudes to volcanic eruptions. We also find evidence that anthropogenic aerosol forcings play a role in driving the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which are key features of the North Atlantic ocean. Overall, the model historical simulations show many features in common with the observed record over the period 1850-2014 and so provide a basis for future in-depth study of recent climate change.},

   abstract = {Theory and model evidence indicate a higher global hydrological sensitivity for the same amount of surface warming to solar as to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, but regional patterns are highly uncertain due to their dependence on circulation and dynamics. We analyse a multi-model ensemble of idealized experiments and a set of simulations of the last millennium and we demonstrate similar global signatures and patterns of forced response in the tropical Pacific, of higher sensitivity for the solar forcing. In the idealized simulations, both solar and GHG forcing warm the equatorial Pacific, enhance precipitation in the central Pacific, and weaken and shift the Walker circulation eastward. Centennial variations in the solar forcing over the last millennium cause similar patterns of enhanced equatorial precipitation and slowdown of the Walker circulation in response to periods with stronger solar forcing. Similar forced patterns albeit of considerably weaker magnitude are identified for variations in GHG concentrations over the 20th century, with the lower sensitivity explained by fast atmospheric adjustments. These findings differ from previous studies that have typically suggested divergent responses in tropical precipitation and circulation between the solar and GHG forcings. We conclude that tropical Walker circulation and precipitation might be more susceptible to solar variability rather than GHG variations during the last-millennium, assuming comparable global mean surface temperature changes.},

   journal = {Quaternary Science Reviews},
   volume = {292},
   pages = {107617},
   abstract = {This study investigates solar variability between 650 CE and 1900 based on new and published 14C records with a time resolution of two years or higher. The new high-resolution 14C data presented here are derived from Danish oak and span the period 1058–1250 CE. We determine the durations of past solar minima and periods with moderate solar activity from the solar modulation potential calculated using a carbon-box model with the high-resolution 14C records as input. The observed intervals of solar minima and intermittent periods with moderate activity levels suggest that a Maunder-type minimum occurred in 656–707 CE. We tentatively propose to name this minimum the Horrebow Minimum after Christian Horrebow, an early Danish astronomer who studied the occurrence of sunspots and was the first to propose that they follow a cyclic behaviour. Changes in amplitude and cycle length of the 11-year solar cycle are investigated by bandpass filtering 23 individual 14C records. The filtered 14C data indicate that the length of the 11-year solar cycle may be prolonged before the onset of the Oort, Maunder, and Spörer minima. The amplitude of the 11-year solar cycle associated with solar minima and periods with moderate solar activity between 650 CE and 1900 is estimated to 1.1‰. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test indicates that there is no significant difference between the amplitude distribution of 11-year solar cycles during solar minima and periods of moderate solar activity. A review of the high-resolution 14C records encompassing the near-Earth supernova events that occurred in 1006 CE, 1054, 1181, 1572, and 1604 suggests that these events were not accompanied by distinct changes in the 14C production rate. Nonetheless, an unusual increase of c. 10‰ in Δ14C between 1048 CE and 1055 is observed and discussed.},

   abstract = {El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) are the dominant modes of climate variability affecting the tropical and subtropical regions. In this study, we investigate the impact of ENSO episodes, through the modulation of the ISM configuration, on the Eastern Mediterranean (EMed) summer atmospheric circulation over the whole 20th century using state of the art model simulations from the 5th phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Results are validated against the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis, ERA-20C. Our findings indicate that the variability of ENSO has a significant impact on the low and middle tropospheric circulation of EMed. La Nina (El Nino) events are related to stronger (weaker) ISM activity, which leads to a deepening (weakening) of the Persian low that affects the EMed tropospheric circulation with stronger (weaker) northerly surface winds over the area. Further, La Nina (El Nino) events are related with stronger (weaker) 500 hPa subsidence over the EMed and an intensification (weakening) of the Subtropical Jet Stream between 35 degrees N to 50 degrees N. This work improves our understanding of the teleconnections between ENSO variability and the EMed summer tropospheric circulation via the modulation of the ISM activity and stresses the importance of ENSO on the EMed climate in summer.},

Early warning systems, activated after volcanic eruptions can alleviate the impacts on aviation by providing forecasts of the volcanic ash plume dispersion. The quality of these short-term forecasts is subject to the accuracy of the meteorological wind fields used for the initialization of regional models. Here, we use wind profiling data from the first high spectral resolution lidar in space, Aeolus, to examine the impact of measured wind fields on regional NWP and subsequent volcanic ash dispersion forecasts, focusing on the case of Etna’s eruption on March 2021. The results from this case study demonstrate a significant improvement of the volcanic ash simulation when using Aeolus-assimilated meteorological fields, with differences in wind speed reaching up to 8 m/s when compared to the control run. When comparing the volcanic ash forecast profiles with downwind surface-based aerosol lidar observations, the modeled field is consistent with the measurements only when Aeolus winds are assimilated. This result clearly demonstrates the potential of Aeolus and highlights the necessity of future wind profiling satellite missions for improving volcanic ash forecasting and hence aviation safety.},
