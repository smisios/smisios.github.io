ALIGNING aims to promote agricultural innovation in Asian least-developed agrarian countries by increasing, first, the innovation capacity of Asian HEIS, and second, by providing farmers and agribusiness practitioners, solutions for a more sustainable and climate-resilient business growth. In the short term, the project will contribute to: (a) validating existing needs analysis in agriculture and climate change as well as analysing current sustainable adaptation practices; (b) improving the capacities of Asian HEIs in innovative actions (d) linking academia with the private sector. This will create a multiplier effect for the recognition of sustainable agriculture as an individual study area and career choice, which will result in a transformed academic environment and a more sustainable economic growth in the context of a least-developed country.
