The Climate-Edu project aims to advance Climate Change Education
(CCE) in Greece by leveraging the Copernicus Climate Change
Service (C3S) data into national educational and professional
training frameworks. Building on the newly established ClimateHub
initiative of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), the project
addresses the fragmented initiatives and limited use of climate
data and services in Greece. Climate-Edu addresses this gap by
producing high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational resources
in Greek, targeting university students (BSc/MSc), secondary school
students and staff of governmental authorities. The project
combines BSc and MSc courses, interactive Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs), summer schools, workshops, public engagement
events, and innovative Meteorological Walking Tours, integrating Greece’s historical meteorological
knowledge with modern C3S datasets.
