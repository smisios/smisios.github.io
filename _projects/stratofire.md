StratoFIRE will address the following key Scientific Questions (SQs):
• SQ1: What is the contribution of smoke in the interannual variability of stratospheric aerosols?
• SQ2: What are the optical and microphysical properties of stratospheric smoke?
• SQ3: What is the net radiative effect of stratospheric smoke and its impact on stratospheric heating?
