In C3S-NCP-Greece we propose to extend the uptake of climate data by the energy sector at lead times
beyond the traditional meteorological forecasts (e.g., 7-15 days). Specifically, C3S-NCP-Greece
upscales the plethora of data provided by the EC under the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)
to include probabilistic forecasts at seasonal (e.g. next-month/summer) and decadal (e.g. next 5-10
years) lead times in energy demand and RES generation and planning. These time scales are not
considered in any national climate service and the C3S-NCP-Greece has identified an
information/service gap in existing workflows and decision planning tools. C3S-NCP-Greece envisions
to promote the development of new national climate services using a seamless methodology from
seasonal to decadal time scales. The new services will benchmark the applicability of near-term
predictions to other key national priorities (e.g. blue economy, tourism, agriculture).

As a first demonstration of the climate services of C3S-NCP-Greece, an Climate service for Energy Hub
portal will be developed to stream the related climate services. This service will provide information
about C3S products and developed services in Greek, showcase success stories, and feature
testimonials from Greek users of C3S. Additionally, the C3S-NCP-Greece website will be linked to the
web-portal that will be created for data distribution and visualisation. The portal will allow end-users
to access, download, and analyse C3S-NCP data products, providing interactive maps, graphs, and
charts to visualise the near-term predictions of essential climate and energy variables. It will also offer
online support and guidance for utilising C3S-NCP-Greece data products.
The main objectives of C3S-NCP-Greece are to:
• support national authorities with new information from C3S.
• develop and operate a seamless prediction system to cover near-term time scales, from
seasonal to decadal.
• apply the prediction system for the energy use case to provide probabilistic forecasts of
energy demand and solar and wind energy production.
• define user-oriented needs and the transferability of the prediction system to other sectors.
• communicate C3S services and news to the academia, industry, non-governmental
organisations, and public stakeholders.
