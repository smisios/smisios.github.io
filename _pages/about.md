I am a atmospheric physicist and climate modeler. My research blends modelling and observations to help articulate the role of external forcings in the climate system. 

I have been involved in the development and evaluation of the MPI-ESM, EMAC/MESSy and HadGEM3-GC3.1 global climate models. I have co-led (with Dr. D.M. Mitchell) the SPARC SolarMIP (Solar Model Intercomparison Project) an international programme for the first ever intercomparison of the CMIP5 climate model simulations in regards to the solar cycle availability and effects in the atmosphere and surface.

I have also deployed instrumentation for measuring Atmospheric Electricity in the Chelmos high-altitude observatory and the Villum Research Station, Greenland.

Lately, I am interested in developing methodologies for climate-related financial disclosures for the benefit of business activities.
